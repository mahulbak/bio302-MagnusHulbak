```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

simulate a 100-observation autocorrelated timeseries with arima.sim with a first order autoregressive coefficient of 0.5. Also make a time vector of 1:100. plot the data

```{r}
y  <- arima.sim(n=100,list(ar=c(.5)))  
ts <-1:100  
plot(y)

```


regress the timeseries against time with an OLS(ordinary least squares/linear) model. Does the model appear to be statistically significant?

```{r}
ols_mod<- lm(y~ts)
summary(ols_mod)
```

Answer: NO, the model does not appear to be statistically significant.

4) Plot the model diagnostics, including an acf() and pacf

```{r}
plot(ols_mod)

```

```{r}
residuals(ols_mod)

```

```{r}
acf(residuals(ols_mod))

```

```{r}
pacf(residuals(ols_mod))
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
